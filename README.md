Problem Statement
With the technological advances in financial infrastructure, most bank customers prefer to use Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) and Internet websites for carrying out their banking transactions. Financial users especially utilize ATMs for physical transactions like cash withdrawal or cash deposit. ATM fraud has recently become more widespread. This system used to avoid the ATM robberies and wrong person miss uses the ATM. In today’s world the main problem in ATM System is lack of Security. Due to this we hear many fraud, robbery cases in our day-to-day life. The main thread behind this is that robber or thief is using someone else debit card of their own personal profit. In Many activities like this the culprit face is covered So, police have to face problem like identify the thief. In these cases there are some known persons of the victim who follow this activity.
Objective of Project
In this project we are developing the software for the enhancement of the ATM machine’s security. By the use of various types of technologies like python, ML, Deep Learning concept etc we are developing the software which detect weather the person withdraw money is wearing mask / cover, if yes then program will deny the permission till one removes the mask. Now when mask is removed the software will take picture of the person and save it in Database for any future reference.
